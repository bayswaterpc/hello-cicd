# hello-cicd
`hello-cicd` is a command-line program for showing how to deploy cross-compiled releases on GitHub using Travis CI.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jonstites/hello-cicd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jonstites/hello-cicd)

## Motivation

CI/CD is like flossing: everyone knows they should do it, but it's not very fun.

Anyway, it turns out that publishing cross-compiled binaries on GitHub for Rust projects is easy, but not super-well documented for some reason.
